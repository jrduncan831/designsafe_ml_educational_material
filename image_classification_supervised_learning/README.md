# Image Classification 

This tutorial has two notebooks which will explore a variety of supervised learning techiques for image classfication.  Each notebook explores a different dataset:

1. city_vs_forest_classifier.ipynb : Classify images of city vs forest images.  This is an easier classfication problem than the Design Safe dataset. 
2. designsafe_classifier.ipynb : Classify images for the design safe dataset.
